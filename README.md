I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard titled "Retail Data Analysis", aimed at providing insights into sales performance across multiple regions and categories. The report includes four main slicers-Country & State, Segment, Category, and Order Date to enable dynamic filtering. I visualized sub-category-wise order quantities using a clustered column chart and showcased region-wise sales using a map visual. A matrix table was used to display city-level sales, quantity, and profit across Furniture and Office Supplies. Additionally, I included a gauge chart to track order priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and a pie chart to break down sales by region and shipping mode, helping users quickly identify consumer trends and distribution types.
